The LUWO Golden Curve (JGC)

Creator: Jax Wolf (JAXW01F)

Year: 2025

The LUWO Golden Curve (JGC) is a phi-scaled parabolic geometry system that redefines curvature behavior using Golden Ratio (ф) expansion, unit-distance perimeter logic, and fractal growth patterns. It generalizes classical parabolas, ellipses, and spirals into a unified curvature framework optimized for natural pattern modeling, optics, resonant structures, and predictive algorithms.
